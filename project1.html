				<p><b>Is justice just?</b></p>
				
				<div class="essay">
			
					<pre>
				
From ancient times the idea of justice concerned societies. In Socrates era, justice was considered as one of the most important 
virtues of life, and law consisted more of moral values, ethics, and customs. Later, the concept of law started to develop another
meaning, declaring its independence from the notion of ethics. This is illustrated explicitly in John Austin’s dogma of legal
positivism “The existence of a law is one thing, its merits or demerits is another”. 
				
Therefore, as a definition, we can all agree that laws are the system of rules which a particular country or community recognizes
as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties.
				
By contrast, ethics is the moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity. (Ethics Definition - Google Search)
				
This means that laws aim to regulate our behavior in order to ensure our living in peace with each other and not in making our lives virtuous,
whatever the latter means for each and one of us. In other words, laws tell people what they must do, whereas ethics tell people what they
should do.
				
This small one-word change may seem minor to a student writing an essay, but it is major to a judge writing a verdict for a case. According to
Judge Patricia M. Wald, a judge should set aside its personal values and adopt the “morality of the jurist.” This mindset advocates implementing 
the judicial decisions by following the ethics of the laws; that is by searching for the timeless and enduring values that reside in the Constitution.
The judge should be able to identify which laws- and hence which values- apply to each case judged in order to reach a fair verdict that represents
the ethics of the Constitution.
				
However, judicial or law decision making on these grounds may conflict with the individual’s belief of what is right or wrong. This happens because
in some cases the conventional morality, meaning the ethics of an ordinary person, could differ from the ethics of laws. Each person’s moral conduct
is influenced by their past experiences, their religious beliefs, their education, their country’s traditions, and other variables. As a result, every 
individual forms its own ethics through which s/he perceives the world and the judicial decisions. This explains why on many occasions, the general
public or a distinct group of people disagree with a court’s decision. 
				
For instance, when an unemployed mother of 4 children is evicted from her house by a court’s verdict, because she could not afford to pay the rent,
she considers this decision extremely unfair, feeling that the law is enforced only against her and never to protect her. From her perspective, the 
judge should take into account that she did not have the ability to pay the rent because the law concerning social benefits or the law protecting
employment is inadequate or not effectively enforced.
