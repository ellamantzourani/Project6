				<pre>	
				Eleni is a sophomore at Northwestern University, majoring in Economics and Computer Science. Eleni
				co-founded an algorithmic trading club at Northwestern, which was her first introduction into the markets.
				Last summer, Eleni did this accounting internship in Athens, where she learned a lot about business operations 
				and how a small company manages its financial capital. Moreover, this winter she interned in a search fund which
				invested in small companies in niche industries and learned a lot about their market trends. As she became more 
				interested in having a larger impact in the industries and the economy in general by working with larger 
				companies, over the summer she will be working at TD securities in their investment banking division.
